## NRK Radio Integration

### NRK Radio Stream URLs
The NRK channels use HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) format:

```
P1: https://lyd.nrk.no/nrk_radio_p1_ostlandssendingen_mp3_h
P2: https://lyd.nrk.no/nrk_radio_p2_mp3_h
P3: https://lyd.nrk.no/nrk_radio_p3_mp3_h
NRK Alltid Nyheter: https://lyd.nrk.no/nrk_radio_alltid_nyheter_mp3_h
```

**Note:** These URLs may need verification and updating. NRK may also provide an API for channel information and metadata.

---

## Deployment

### Windows Distribution
- **Installer:** electron-builder (NSIS or Squirrel)
- **Auto-update:** electron-updater
- **Code signing:** Optional but recommended

### Build Process
1. Compile TypeScript
2. Bundle with Webpack/Vite
3. Package with electron-builder
4. Create installer (.exe)
5. Generate update files

### CI/CD Pipeline (✅ Implemented - March 2026)

#### GitHub Actions Workflows
Two automated workflows have been set up and debugged:

1. **Bump Version Workflow** (`.github/workflows/bump-version.yml`)
   - Manual trigger via GitHub Actions UI
   - Bumps version in package.json (patch/minor/major)
   - Creates and pushes git tag using PAT_TOKEN
   - Triggers release workflow automatically
   - **Status:** ✅ Configured with PAT_TOKEN for workflow chaining

2. **Release Workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
   - Triggered automatically on tag push (v*.*.*)
   - Runs on windows-latest
   - Installs dependencies with `npm install` (no lock file required)
   - Builds Windows executable with electron-builder
   - Packages application with `npm run dist:win`
   - Creates GitHub Release with artifacts (.exe, .zip, .yml)
   - **Status:** ✅ Fixed npm caching and install issues

#### Setup Requirements (✅ Completed)
- **PAT_TOKEN:** Fine-grained Personal Access Token configured in repository secrets
  - Scope: Repository-specific (myradio repo only)
  - Permissions: Contents (Read and write), Metadata (Read-only)
  - Purpose: Allow bump-version workflow to trigger release workflow
  - **Note:** Default GITHUB_TOKEN cannot trigger workflows from workflows

#### Known Issues & Fixes Applied
- ✅ Fixed: Workflow chaining - Changed from GITHUB_TOKEN to PAT_TOKEN
- ✅ Fixed: npm cache error - Removed cache requirement (no package-lock.json)
- ✅ Fixed: npm ci error - Changed to npm install for flexibility

#### Release Process
1. Go to GitHub Actions → "Bump Version" workflow
2. Click "Run workflow" and select version bump type (patch/minor/major)
3. Workflow creates tag and triggers automatic build/release
4. Release appears in GitHub Releases with Windows installer

**Alternative:** Manually push a tag to trigger release:
```bash
git tag v1.0.X
git push origin v1.0.X
```
